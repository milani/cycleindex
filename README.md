Cycle Index
===========

This package implements Cycle Index using the algorithm described in the paper "A general purpose algorithm for counting simple cycles and simple paths of any length"[1].

The cycle counting algorithm is a python implementation of [Matlab code](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/comnet/cnx005/3799993/Evaluating-balance-on-social-networks-from-their) provided by the author of the paper.

### TODO
* Implement Monte Carlo approach to evaluate the index for large networks
